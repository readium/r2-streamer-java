				To be, or not to be--that is the question:<br/>
				Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>
				The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune<br/>
				Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br/>
				And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--<br/>
				No more--and by a sleep to say we end<br/>
				The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks<br/>
				That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation<br/>
				Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--<br/>
				To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,<br/>
				For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br/>
				When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br/>
				Must give us pause. There's the respect<br/>
				That makes calamity of so long life.<br/>
				For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br/>
				Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely<br/>
				The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br/>
				The insolence of office, and the spurns<br/>
				That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,<br/>
				When he himself might his quietus make<br/>
				With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,<br/>
				To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br/>
				But that the dread of something after death,<br/>
				The undiscovered country, from whose bourn<br/>
				No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br/>
				And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br/>
				Than fly to others that we know not of?<br/>
				Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br/>
				And thus the native hue of resolution<br/>
				Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br/>
				And enterprise of great pitch and moment<br/>
				With this regard their currents turn awry<br/>
				And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now,<br/>
				The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons<br/>
				Be all my sins remembered.</p>
